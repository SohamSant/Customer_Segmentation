{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# 1 - Our Goal : \n","\n","In this project, we will use K-means clustering and PCA to perform customer segmentation based on their purchasing behavior in an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers with similar preferences and behaviors, enabling personalized marketing strategies and recommendations. \n","\n","Extract relevant features from the dataset that capture customer behavior, such as purchase history, order frequency, total spending, etc. Calculate additional metrics if necessary, such as recency of purchase or average basket size. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative features\n","\n","Determining Optimal Number of Clusters: Use the elbow method or silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means. Experiment with different values of K and evaluate the clustering results. K-means Clustering: Perform K-means clustering on the reduced feature space. Assign each customer to a cluster based on their feature values. Analyze the resulting clusters and interpret the characteristics of each segment. Cluster Profiling: Profile each cluster by calculating cluster-specific metrics, such as average spending, purchase frequency, or popular product categories. Identify the key characteristics and behaviors that distinguish each cluster. Visualization: Visualize the clusters and their separation using scatter plots or other suitable techniques. Plot the clusters based on the reduced feature space to understand the distribution and overlap of customers\n","\n","Evaluate the quality of the clustering results using appropriate metrics such as silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). Assess the cohesion and separation of the clusters to determine the effectiveness of the segmentation. Personalization and Recommendations: Based on the identified customer segments, develop personalized marketing strategies and recommendations. Tailor promotions, product suggestions, or communication channels for each cluster to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.\n","\n","Interpret the results and provide insights about the different customer segments. Discuss the implications for the e-commerce business, such as targeted marketing, customer retention, or inventory management. Remember to adhere to ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations while working with customer data.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# 2 - import important
